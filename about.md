# About me

Hi there! My name is Nic Young and I am Software Engineer. I live and work from
beautiful Denver, Colorado (which also happens to be my hometown). I started my
career many years ago working in the backend of the web stack mainly in Python.
Recently, I have been working completely in the frontend of the stack mainly
with React.

Apart from computers I love spending time with my wife and 2 dogs. I also enjoy
hiking, brewing (and enjoying) beer, hockey and writing. I am always trying to
channel my inner Dale Cooper in all aspects of my life and I always try to come
up with witty puns (though I am pretty bad at it).

# Projects

## Active
- [Burgundy Rainbow](https://burgundy-rainbow.com/) - I helped co-found this
  site after our previous community was taken over by a hostile managing editor.
  We are slowly becoming the biggest fan run Avalanche hockey blog on the
  interwebs. We have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/5HqQrgf) too, come join us!

- [Co-Chapter Leader for Operation Code Denver](https://www.operationcode.org/) - 
  Operation Code is a non-profit organization that helps veterans, military
  spouses and pretty much anyone launch careers in software development by
  helping them learn to code and providing mentorship. I am co-chair of the
  local Denver chapter which helps run local hackathons and meetups as well as
  local mentorship.


## Retired 

- [Algorithms](https://github.com/nryoung/algorithms) - This was a repo I
  orginally started when I was struggling with my algorithms course. It seems
  there was a demand for this kind of educational repo as I received tons of PR's
  and issues. I reviewed all PR's personally and added auto generated
  documention and CI pipeline for this project.

- [Python Morsels](https://github.com/nryoung/python_morsels) - I created this
  for common Python patterns that I wanted documented as I kept coming across
  them.

- [Micro Compiler](https://github.com/nryoung/micro_compiler) - This was a micro
  compiler that I wrote from scratch for my compilers course.

- [Universal Compiler](https://github.com/nryoung/universal_compiler) - This was
	also for my compiler course, but is an implementation of a more complete compiler.

- [Array Size](https://github.com/nryoung/Array-Size) - A project I created when I
  was working as a Systems Administrator to help me figure out array sizes with
  different RAID configurations.
