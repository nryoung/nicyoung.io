# About me

Howdy! My name is Nic Young I live in beautiful Denver, Colorado. I am a
Software Engineer by trade and I have worked in all areas of the stack through
out my career, from writing ETL pipelines, to writing REST and GraphQL API's, to
writing UI's on the frontend. I don't prefer a particular area of the stack, I
just like to work on interesting problems.

Apart from computers I love spending time with my wife, my son and my 2 dogs. I also enjoy
hiking, brewing (and enjoying) beer, hockey, gardening and writing. I am always trying to
channel my inner [Dale Cooper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYh2PmsFuOQ) in all aspects of my life.

# Projects

## Active
- [Burgundy Review](https://burgundy-review.com/) - I helped co-found this
  site after our previous community was taken over by a hostile managing editor.
  We are slowly becoming the biggest fan run Avalanche hockey blog on the
  interwebs. We have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/5HqQrgf) too, come join us!

## Retired

- [Co-Chapter Leader for Operation Code Denver](https://www.operationcode.org/) - 
  Operation Code is a non-profit organization that helps veterans, military
  spouses and pretty much anyone launch careers in software development by
  helping them learn to code and providing mentorship. I was co-chair of the
  local Denver chapter which helps run local hackathons and meetups as well as
  local mentorship.

- [Algorithms](https://github.com/nryoung/algorithms) - This was a repo I
  orginally started when I was struggling with my algorithms course. It seems
  there was a demand for this kind of educational repo as I received tons of PR's
  and issues. I reviewed all PR's personally and added auto generated
  documention and CI pipeline for this project.

- [Python Morsels](https://github.com/nryoung/python_morsels) - I created this
  for common Python patterns that I wanted documented as I kept coming across
  them.

- [Micro Compiler](https://github.com/nryoung/micro_compiler) - This was a micro
  compiler that I wrote from scratch for my compilers course.

- [Universal Compiler](https://github.com/nryoung/universal_compiler) - This was
	also for my compiler course, but is an implementation of a more complete compiler.

- [Array Size](https://github.com/nryoung/Array-Size) - A project I created when I
  was working as a Systems Administrator to help me figure out array sizes with
  different RAID configurations.
