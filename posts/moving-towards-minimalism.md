# Moving towards minimalism

*Smile, breathe and go slowly. -- Thich Nhat Hanh.*


## This blog

I have been working on revamping this blog for at least 6 months. I initially
started rewriting it using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). However, as I
was working on it, I realized how much boilerplate I was writing and how
complex using Gatsby actually is. It was especially hard since I would work on
the blog intermittently over the months, so it was tough to understand all of
the moving parts once I came back to it. Also, I found myself spending tons of
time adding new features and tinkering with CSS instead of actually writing
articles.

Inspired by [Dan Luu's aricle about web bloat](https://danluu.com/web-bloat/) I
have decided to take this blog in a different direction. Firstly, I switched to
[11ty](https://www.11ty.io/) which is a dead simple static site generator that
barely requires any configuration to just work. Second, I have decided to keep
the CSS dead simple inspired by [Better Mother Fucking
Website](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/) and hopefully screen reader
friendly. Switching to this new direction has already reaped benefits as I have
been able to add all of the pages I want and arrange things how I want in such a
small time frame. 

Hopefully switching this blog to a minimalist direction will clear up my
time and head space to write more meaningful articles.

## My life

This experience has also inspired me to look towards my life with the same
critical eye. Slowly, I have noticed half finished projects and unread books
piling up in my life. Not only that, I have noticed that random items have just
been accumulating and collecting dust. Therefore I will be declaring this the
year of nothing new. I say year here but I actually mean 8 months, since I like
to keep track of milestones via my birthday, which is in August.

With this in mind, I intend to read all of the unread books that are present on
my bookshelf, that includes you too Don Quixote. The number of books I have
unread should keep occupied until August. If not, I can alway rent more from the
library as I will have worked my way through all of the non new books.

Project wise, this means I will need to finish all of the projects that I have
started but abandoned (this blog being one of them). This includes not only
technical projects but also projects around the house, like adding bookshelves
to my office closet. I have tons and tons of projects to keep me occupied until
August for sure, so I am definitely not worried about running out of work. Also,
I will be contributing to some open source projects that I have been meaning to
for quite some time as well.

I intend to keep track of my progress via writing articles on this blog. This
will also, hopefully force me to write more which has been a goal of mine for
much too long.
