## Buying more than we need

I looked at my bookcase the other day and realized that I had over #number of
books in there that I have never read before. Subsequently, I looked through my
closet and realized there are shirts, pants and shorts that I haven't worn in
years (random tech conferences and beer festivals). I then looked at all of the
unread books that are sitting on my bookshelf collecting dust. The worst,
though, was looking at all of the unfinished projects that I had started but
never even got close to finishing. For example I have a closet in my office that
has zero shelves in it and it is just crying out for shelves, all my junk is
just piled on top of eachother at the bottom of it and it is horrible to try to
find anything. A more technical example is the blog, I have been working on and
off for months upon months to add the blog portion of my website and I just
haven't mustered the willpower to finish it.

## Gameplan
Because of all of this I am declaring this the year of nothing new. Well
technically, it is 8 months and 3 weeks until August 1st. Why the 1st do you
ask, because that is my birthday and I like to make resolutions based on my
birthday and not the new year. It's time to start going slowly, stop being
distracted and start getting to work. The way I will be tackling this is in a
few ways.

1. I am going to be going through all of my clothes and boxing up the ones I
   don't want to wear or that don't fit anymore and I am going to box them up. I
   am giving myself a timeline 2 months to lose weight for the clothes that no
   longer fit, but I do want to keep.

2. As far as books and reading, I am not going to buy or checkout from the
   library any new books until I have read all of the ones on my bookshelf.
   There maybe some duds among those books but I will read at least a third of
   the way through them before I give up.

3. The long list of projects that I have queued up I will be tackling by
   sticking to one project at a time, both around the house or technical. If a
   project doesn't prove viable, I need to stick with it long enough and prove
   out why something isn't viable before I move on to the next thing.

4. My health and wellness begins now. I have packed on some pounds recently that
   I have been very unhappy with. Also, I plan to run the Colfax marathon and my
   weight and overall health aren't were I want them to be to be able to
   accomplish such a feat.


I am hoping as I write about my journey my writing becomes better because I know
particular at this point of time I have a ton of rust and I haven't written
something this long in a long time.
